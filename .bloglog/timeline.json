      "summary": "This development conversation accomplished building BlogLog, a meta-tool for documenting development work in real-time, using Claude Code as the primary development approach. Key decisions made include: using a CLI-first design that wraps git commits (`bl commit` replaces `git commit -m`), implementing a Next.js web interface for longer captures and timeline viewing, storing data in JSON files for simplicity, and designing for zero-friction habit formation in the developer workflow. The project serves as both a practical documentation tool and a learning vehicle for Claude Code, with the meta-aspect of using BlogLog to document its own creation being a central theme throughout development.",

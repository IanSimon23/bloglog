  "problem": "Developers do interesting work but don't document it effectively. Manual blog writing happens retrospectively (if at all), losing the narrative of decisions, blockers, and breakthroughs as they happen.",
  "goals": "Learn Claude Code workflow and capabilities. Build practical CLI tool development skills. Practice habit-forming tool design (zero friction).",
  "successCriteria": "Zero friction: `bl commit` becomes natural replacement for `git commit`. Works seamlessly alongside existing workflow. Generates usable blog post draft from 30-60 min development session."
